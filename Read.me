# Segmentation_DeepLabV3

This repository contains an implementation of the DeepLabV3 model for image segmentation. The DeepLabV3 model is a deep learning architecture that is widely used for pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. This implementation utilizes the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the benefits of dilated convolutions to achieve accurate and efficient segmentation results.

## Installation

To use the Segmentation_DeepLabV3 code, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Segmentation_DeepLabV3.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary libraries and packages needed to run the code.

## Usage

The Segmentation_DeepLabV3 codebase provides a user-friendly interface to train and evaluate the DeepLabV3 model for image segmentation tasks. The main steps to use the code are as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: Organize your dataset in the desired directory structure. The dataset should be divided into two folders: one for input images and one for corresponding ground truth masks. The file names of the images and masks should match.

2. **Configuration**: Adjust the configuration parameters in the `config.py` file according to your requirements. Specify the paths to your dataset, the model hyperparameters, and other settings such as batch size, learning rate, etc.

3. **Training**: To train the DeepLabV3 model, run the following command:

   ```
   python train.py
   ```

   The training script will load the dataset, initialize the model, and start the training process. It will save the model checkpoints and the training logs to the specified directories.

4. **Inference**: Once the model is trained, you can use it to perform inference on new images. To do this, run the following command:

   ```
   python inference.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
   ```

   Replace `path_to_image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to perform segmentation on. The script will load the trained model checkpoint and generate a segmentation mask for the input image.
